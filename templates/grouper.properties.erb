# Grouper uses Grouper Configuration Overlays (documented on wiki)
# By default the configuration is read from grouper.base.properties
# (which should not be edited), and the grouper.properties overlays
# the base settings.  See the grouper.base.properties for the possible
# settings that can be applied to the grouper.properties


# differentiate test vs dev vs prod for logging and emailing
grouper.env.name = <%=@environment_name %>

# the URL which will be used in emails to users.
#e.g. https://server.school.edu/grouper/

grouper.ui.url = <%=@ui_url %>

# auto-created wheel group for convenience
configuration.autocreate.system.groups = true

# A wheel group allows you to enable non-GrouperSystem subjects to act
# like a root user when interacting with the registry.
groups.wheel.use = true



# generally should be false
